# Talk about Fossil SCM

I gave this short talk about [Fossil SCM](https://www.fossil-scm.org/) at the
[vienna.rb](http://www.vienna-rb.at/) meetup on December 7th 2017.

The talk slides themselves are built with HexaPDF 0.6.0 and need the [SourceSansPro] and
[SourceCodePro] fonts, see `talk.rb`. Run `ruby talk.rb FONT_ROOT` to build the `talk.pdf` file
which is best viewed in presentation mode.

[SourceCode]: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro
