# Talk about turtle graphics

I gave this talk about the implementation of turtle graphics in Ruby with HexaPDF as backend at the
[vienna.rb](http://www.vienna-rb.at/) meetup on February 2nd 2017.

The talk slides themselves were also built with HexaPDF, see `talk.rb`. Just run `ruby talk.rb` to
build the `talk.pdf` file which is best viewed in presentation mode.

Note that you need to use the repository version of HexaPDF for correct results!
