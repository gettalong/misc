# Talk about Ruby 2.5/2.6 and its new features and performance improvements

I gave this short talk at the [vienna.rb](http://www.vienna-rb.at/) meetup on
August 23rd 2018.

The talk slides can be built by running the `build_slides.sh` script which uses
the `slideshow` gem and its reveal.js theme behind the scenes.
